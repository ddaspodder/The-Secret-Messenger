			<h2>Cryptography and its types</h2>
			<p>
			Cryptography or cryptology, is the practice and study of hiding information.It is the science used to try to keep information secret and safe. 
			Cryptography is used in ATM (bank) cards, computer passwords, and shopping on the internet.When a message is sent using cryptography, it is changed (or encrypted) before it is sent. The method of changing text is called a "code" or, more precisely, a "cipher". The changed text is called "ciphertext". 
			The change makes the message hard to read. Someone who wants to read it must change it back (or decrypt it). 
			How to change it back is a secret. 
			Both the person that sends the message and the one that gets it should know the secret way to change it, but other people should not be able to. 
			Studying the cyphertext to discover the secret is called "cryptanalysis" or "cracking" or sometimes "code breaking".
			Different types of cryptography can be easier or harder to use and can hide the secret message better or worse.
			Ciphers use a "key" which is a secret that hides the secret messages. 
			Ciphers that allow billions of keys are cracked by more complex methods.

			Types of Steganography:
            <ul class="styledlist">
                <li>Symmetric</li>
                <li>Asymettric</li>
            </ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>
			<p>
			In symmetric cryptography, both the sender and receiver share the key. 
			The sender uses the key in a certain way to hide the message. 
			Then, the receiver will use the same key in the opposite way to reveal the message. Most types of cryptography are symmetric. 
			Advanced Encryption Standard is a widely used one. 
			</p>
			<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>
			<p>
			Asymmetric cryptography is harder to use.
			Each person who wants to use asymmetric cryptography uses a secret key number, and a different number, a "public key" that they can tell everyone.
			If someone else wants to send this person a message, they'll use the number they've been told to hide the message. Now the message cannot be revealed, even by the sender, but the receiver can easily reveal the message with his secret or "private key". 
			This way, nobody else needs to know the secret key. RSA is a commonly used assymetric encryption technique.
